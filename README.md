Exploration of 2015-2016 California public school SAT score data using SQL

SAT Data was pulled from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlocking-achievement-understanding-california-s

School Data for College Going Rate was pulled from California Department of Education website: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/downloadabledata.asp

Graphs of District SAT Scores vs. College Going Rate for the top 5 most populous counties in California can be found in Excel file

Graphs seem to show no correlation in a district's average SAT score and its college rate. Not too surprising considering there are many more factors that contribute to the acceptance of a student into a university. In fact, college going rate is rather constant among the analyzed districts with an average college going rate ~85%. Likely implications are that SAT score is more important for a student trying to enroll in a particular university, evidenced by looking at average SAT scores for freshman classes at Ivy Leagues and other prestigous universities.
