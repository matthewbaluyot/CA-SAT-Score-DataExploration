Graphs seem to show no correlation in a district's average SAT score and its college rate. Not too surprising considering there are many more factors that contribute to the acceptance of a student into a university. In fact, college going rate is rather constant among the analyzed districts with an average college going rate ~85%. Likely implications are that SAT score is more important for a student trying to enroll in a particular university, evidenced by looking at average SAT scores for freshman classes at Ivy Leagues and other prestigous universities.
